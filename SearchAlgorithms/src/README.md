These algorithms are both used for traversing and locating a node in a tree. The DFS(Depth First Search) 
algorithm travers the tree by starting with the left side and traversing the deepest node first and works
back up. This is not an optimal algoritm. 

The BFS (Bredth first Search) algorithm traverses a tree by levels. It starts with the head node and will
work down level by level until finding the desired node. This is an optimal algorithm.
