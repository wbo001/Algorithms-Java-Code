The program is a project I completed at Bridgewater Coleege. This program takes in a collection of nodes and edges.
Each edge has a value associated with it that is the "cost" to traverse said edge. This algorithm will produce a 
tree that includes all the nodes with the minimum amount of edges with the lowest total cost.
