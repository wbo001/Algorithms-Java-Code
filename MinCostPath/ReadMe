This is a java project I worked on for a class at Bridgewater College. This particular algorithm will take in a collection of 
nodes and edges. For each edge their is a value associated with the edge that is the "cost" to traverse it. This algorithm
will determine the path with the least cost from the start node to a specifed node in the tree.
